## Notes On Behavior
- Most students did what they were asked of. 
- One student did not pay attention during class; this can be remedied by focusing on them more.

## Material Covered
- For Loops *Some students need more practice with this!*
- If Statements
- While Loops
- JQuery Selectors *Many students had issues connecting HTML to JavaScript due to a lack of understanding their differences and why selectors are used. In the future teach why we use selectors.*
- Variables & Data Types
- Math Ops

## Homework Given
Make a basic calculator with 3 inputs and buttons to represent operators.
### Ideas for Week 2:
- Mad Libs
- Pig Latin Translator (Hard)

## Week 1 Synopsis
All in all, everything went pretty well! The students knew more commands and syntax than we thought they would, but they had trouble understanding concepts. **Next week** we will focus on using functions and go over all material covered to ensure mastery.

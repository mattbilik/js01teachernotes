**_Make an Instagram look alike website_**



*   **(Easy)..........................................................................................................................................**
*   **Create a form**
    *   **Create an input for an image url**
        *   Create input which asks how many images the user wants to upload
            *   Display more image inputs relating to the amount of images they want to upload
    *   **Have the user create a regular text box input for a caption**
    *   **Create a submit button**
        *   On submit, the image should append beneath the form with the caption right beneath the image
*   (Medium)...........................................................................................................................................................
            *   Create a for loop which reads if the image is odd or even and display CSS borders for odd images and Dashed borders for even images. Within the list of images, the borders around the images should be    ( Solid border, Dashed border, Solid border, Dashed border)*   
**(Hard).........................................................................................................................................
**
   **Create a feature which deletes the oldest post**
    *   This function should loop through the number of post on a page, and if the number exceeds 8 post, the 9th post should always be deleted.*  
    **Figure out how to upload images using HTML and incorporate them into your code!**
